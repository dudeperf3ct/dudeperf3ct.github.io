I am using [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/) especially the [Vim mode](https://zed.dev/docs/vim) for quite some time. VSCode editor my previous thing. The experience on VSCode was laggy and slow. I'll blame my machine for that, rather than my not-so-great Vim skills.

I quite like the [Camouflage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zeybek.camouflage) VSCode extension by [zeybek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/zeybek). This extension hides the sensitive environment variables in the `.env` file by hiding their values. No more "oops" moment.

Perfect excuse to learn Rust - Create a similar extension for Zed.
