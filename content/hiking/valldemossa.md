## Direction

Valldemossa is a beautiful village tucked away in the mountains. During my trip, I stayed in Palma, which has a direct bus to Valldemossa. The journey from Palma took about an hour.

## Experience

The start was a bit frustrating, with several dead ends and signs warning to stay off private property. Fortunately, we eventually found a path that marked the beginning of our hike and it was amazing. The trail was enjoyable, made even better by the fantastic company of my best friend and the stories he told along the way.

## Podcast Recommendation

Instead of a music, I would like to recommend one of my favorite podcast.
