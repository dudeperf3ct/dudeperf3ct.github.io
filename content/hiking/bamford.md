## Directions

There is a direct train from Manchester Piccadilly to Bamford. The journey takes about 1 hour.

## Experience

It’s a fairly long walk from Bamford station to the starting point at Stanage Edge. While there’s a road accessible by car that takes you right to the base of the hill, arriving on foot adds quite a bit of extra distance. After the hike, the walk back to the station felt especially long and tiring. In total, I covered around 8 additional kilometres just getting to and from the station -- excluding the actual hike.

## All Trails

* [Bamford Edge and Stanage Edge Circular](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/england/derbyshire/bamford-edge-and-stanage-edge-circular)

I recommend taking the anti-clockwise route.
