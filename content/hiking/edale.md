This was my first hike after moving to Manchester.

## Directions

I took a direct train from Manchester Piccadilly to Edale. It is about 45 mins of journey.

## All Trails

* [Edale Circular Walk](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/england/derbyshire/edale-circular-walk)

* [Edale Stride](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/england/derbyshire/edale-stride)

On reaching there, I found out that the mobile network was very poor. Thankfully, I had downloaded the hike route offline.
