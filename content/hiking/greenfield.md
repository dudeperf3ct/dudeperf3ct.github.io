## Directions

My journey to Greenfield was a 2-stop journey where there was a direct train from Manchester Piccadilly to Stalybridge. In Stalybridge, there was a rail replacement coach to Greenfield.

There might also be direct trains from Manchester Piccadilly to Greenfield station.

## Experience

The replacement coach drops you off at Greenfield station. It's roughly a five-kilometre walk to the reservoir from the station. Partway along, you come to a fork in the road marked [Private -- No Public Right of Way](https://www.google.com/maps/@53.5326533,-1.9976885,3a,68.5y,73.16h,71.11t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sDqjaa-GGsHUpUqdDZhj2Gg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D18.891908598050804%26panoid%3DDqjaa-GGsHUpUqdDZhj2Gg%26yaw%3D73.1642115930564!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) so google maps suggested a rather dubious detour around it. On my way back, I discovered that the private path is actually open to walkers.

The hike was long. The track going up to the Chew Reservior is well maintained. The route from there on is not well marked so you have to be careful and keep checking if you are on right track.
